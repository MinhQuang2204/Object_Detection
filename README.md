# Project Description: Object Recognition Using Yolov4 with Streamlit Interface

## Overview
This project aims to develop a web application for recognizing common objects in images using the Yolov4 object detection model. The user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload images and view detection results in real-time.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilize the powerful Yolov4 model to accurately detect and label common objects in uploaded images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface created with Streamlit, making it easy for users to interact with the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Yolov4**: A state-of-the-art object detection model known for its accuracy and speed.
- **Streamlit**: An open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
- **Python**: The main programming language used for developing the application.

## Run the Streamlit application
 ```bash
   streamlit run home.py
